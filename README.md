# KS1QuizApp

This is a multiple choice quiz application created in Android Studio for the **Mobile 
Application development Module**

written in **Kotlin**

This application consists of two portals. One for Teachers and one for students 
The teacher portal allows a teacher of key stage 1 students to enter the portal and 
add quizes based around a topic. They may add as many quizes as they like and this is then saved to a 
SQLite database.

The teacher portal needs a login system built into it so that authorized teachers can enter 
to add quizes. At this current time it is open for anyone to use.
